Guidelines for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal Jekyll website hosted on GitHub Pages at [azborgonovo.github.io](https://azborgonovo.github.io). It is bilingual (English and Portuguese BR) using [jekyll-polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot).

## Key Conventions

### Bilingual Setup (jekyll-polyglot)

- `parallel_localization: false` is **required** — parallel forks share the memoized `@url` on `Jekyll::Page` before `site.active_lang` is injected into the Liquid payload, causing incorrect language detection.
- Both `index.md` and `pt-br/index.md` must carry `permalink: /` — this gives them the same `page_id` so polyglot correctly excludes the EN fallback during the PT-BR build pass.
- All posts (EN and PT-BR) live in the root `_posts/` directory with a `lang:` front matter key (`en` or `pt-br`). Do **not** put posts in `pt-br/_posts/` — that would produce double-prefix URLs like `/pt-br/pt-br/geral/…`.
- Use `{% if site.active_lang == 'pt-br' %}` in layouts/includes to switch text between languages.
- Post listings filter by `post.lang` to show only the relevant language's posts.

### Front Matter Requirements

**Posts** must include:
```yaml
---
lang: en          # or pt-br
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [category]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

**PT-BR pages** in `pt-br/` must include `lang: pt-br` and `permalink:` matching their EN counterpart.

### Liquid-syntax content in posts

Jekyll processes all `.md` files through Liquid before rendering. Any `{{ }}` or `{% %}` patterns in post body text or fenced code blocks are interpreted as Liquid tags — if the variable doesn't exist, it renders as empty string. Wrap such content in `{% raw %}` / `{% endraw %}` tags to display it literally:

    {% raw %}
    ```
    {{webhookData.ref}} starts with refs/heads/
    ```
    {% endraw %}

### Styles

All CSS lives in `assets/css/style.scss`. The colour palette uses SCSS variables defined at the top of the file (GitHub dark theme: background `#0d1117`, text `#f0f6fc`, accent purple `#a371f7`, accent blue `#58a6ff`). Add new styles there; avoid inline styles except for minor one-off overrides in page content.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install
npm install
npx playwright install

# Build the site
bundle exec jekyll build

# Serve locally (rebuilds on change)
bundle exec jekyll serve

# View at http://localhost:4000

# Run end-to-end tests (builds the site automatically)
npm test
```

After making changes, validate by running `npm test` and checking that all Playwright tests pass.

### Test naming convention

Test files live in `tests/` and follow the pattern `<feature>.spec.ts`, where `<feature>` describes what is being tested (not which content exercises it). Current test files:

- `homepage.spec.ts` — EN and PT-BR homepage structure and content
- `navigation.spec.ts` — language toggle and nav link behaviour
- `posts.spec.ts` — post listing pages (language isolation)
- `liquid-expressions.spec.ts` — verifies `{{ }}` patterns render literally in posts

When adding a new content feature (layout, component, routing), add or extend an appropriate spec file. When writing a post that uses Liquid-syntax code examples (wrapped in `{% raw %}…{% endraw %}`), add a test case in `liquid-expressions.spec.ts` to guard against regressions.

## CI/CD Pipeline

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs on every push to `main` and on manual dispatch:

1. **build** — `bundle exec jekyll build` and uploads the `_site/` artifact.
2. **test** — runs in parallel with build; installs Ruby + Node.js 24, then `npm test` (Playwright on Chromium).
3. **deploy** — depends on both `build` and `test` succeeding; deploys to GitHub Pages.

Playwright HTML reports are uploaded as workflow artifacts (30-day retention) for failure analysis.

## Adding Content

### New English blog post

Create `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` with `lang: en`.

### New Portuguese blog post

Create `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug-pt-br.md` with `lang: pt-br` (same date, different slug convention).

### New page

- English: create `page-name.md` at the root with `lang: en`.
- Portuguese: create `pt-br/page-name.md` with `lang: pt-br` and the same `permalink:` value as the English counterpart (without the `/pt-br/` prefix — polyglot handles prefixing for non-default languages).
- Add the new page link to `_includes/header.html` under both the `pt-br` and `else` nav sections.
