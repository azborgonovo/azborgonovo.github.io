Welcome to my personal website and blog! I'm a software engineer who loves building things and writing about them.

## What to Expect

In this blog I'll share:

- **Technical articles** — Deep dives into software engineering topics
- **Tutorials** — Step-by-step guides on tools and technologies
- **Reflections** — Thoughts on software craft, productivity, and career

## Why a Blog?

Writing is one of the best ways to consolidate learning. Every time I solve an interesting problem or discover something new, I want to capture that knowledge and share it — both for others who might run into the same challenges and for my future self.

## Let's Connect

If something I write resonates with you, feel free to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/azborgonovo), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/azborgonovo), or [X](https://x.com/azborgonovo).

Happy reading! 🚀
