Welcome! This is the first post on my personal website.

I built this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and host it on GitHub Pages.
It's a simple place where I'll share thoughts on software engineering, interesting
problems I'm working on, and occasional notes on tools and practices I find valuable.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- Software architecture and design patterns
- Development workflows and tooling
- Lessons learned from real-world projects
- Anything else I find worth sharing

Stay tuned, and feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }})
or [X](https://x.com/{{ site.x_username }}) if you'd like to chat.
