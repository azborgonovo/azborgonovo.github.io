Here I am back into writing about technical stuff again! It's since I have moved from Brazil to the Netherlands that a long gap happened in my public writing.

It's not like I stopped writing at all: Soon after my arrival in Eindhoven, I shared my initial [impressions about the Dutch worklife](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-reasons-why-i-am-glad-working-netherlands-andre-borgonovo/) on LinkedIn.  

It's also not like I stopped engaging in community events: In 2022 César, Steve, Israel and I started hosting the Eindhoven Kotlin User Group (yes, I've got to learn a bit about Kotlin!). In there I shared some thoughts about API design and gRPC under a catchy slogan "gRPC: the silver bullet of API design?". As a participant, I also joined the Kotlin Dev Day 2022 and the AWS Summit Amsterdam 2025.

During this **hiatus** I also had my debut in podcasts. I have joined Patrick Akil in the Beyond Code Podcast twice: first to talk about 
[modular software development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1GUUublWxc) and later to have a good conversation about [how teams and architecture influence each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi6-DnxAoQ0). In the "Leap into Tech" I participated in a roundtable with Ben Quinn, Mark Scheepens, and Kim van Wilgen about [Diversity in the Tech Market](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02DUAajVD395X0lh91tgPf).

Another unexpected debut was my first ever contribution to the Miroverse with a Miro template for skething [Impact Networks](https://miro.com/templates/impact-network-inet/). If you don't know what an Impact Network is I strongly recommend checking the Impact Intelligence book by Sriram Narayan.

While I have not posted much text publicly I did write significantly for my employers: plenty of Wiki pages, .md files, C4 diagrams. I do hope that the knowledge and documentation I write is useful to my colleagues. But I am also aware of the [value of my keystrokes](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes) and I want them to have a broader reach when applicable.
