Here I am, back to writing publicly - and it feels long overdue. Moving from Brazil to the Netherlands a few years back kicked off a string of new adventures that quietly pushed blogging to the back seat. This post is me reclaiming that seat.

## I never really stopped writing

Soon after my arrival in Eindhoven, I shared my initial [impressions about the Dutch worklife](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-reasons-why-i-am-glad-working-netherlands-andre-borgonovo/) on LinkedIn. And for my employers I wrote plenty: Wiki pages, .md files, C4 diagrams. Hopefully that has been useful to my colleagues and will be useful to my future self. But internal documents, by definition, stay inside.

## I kept showing up in the community

Between 2022 and 2023, César, Steve, Israel and I hosted the Eindhoven Kotlin User Group (yes, I got to learn a bit about Kotlin!). There, I shared my thoughts about API design and gRPC under a catchy slogan *gRPC: the silver bullet of API design?*. As a participant, I also joined the Kotlin Dev Day 2022 and the AWS Summit Amsterdam 2025, which were both lively and informative events!

## New formats

During this *hiatus* I also had my debut in podcasts. I joined Patrick Akil in the Beyond Code Podcast twice: first to talk about [modular software development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1GUUublWxc) and later to have a good conversation about [how teams and architecture influence each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi6-DnxAoQ0). In the *Leap into Tech* I participated in a roundtable with Ben Quinn, Mark Scheepens, and Kim van Wilgen about [Diversity in the Tech Market](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02DUAajVD395X0lh91tgPf).

Another unexpected debut was my first ever contribution to the Miroverse with a Miro template for sketching [Impact Networks](https://miro.com/templates/impact-network-inet/). If you don't know what an Impact Network is, I strongly recommend checking the *Impact Intelligence* book by Sriram Narayan.

## So, why now?

As John Udell challenged in his post: [Too busy to blog? Count your keystrokes](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes).

Writing is one of the best ways to consolidate learning. Every time I solve an interesting problem or discover something new, I want to capture that knowledge and share it, both for others who might run into the same challenges and for my future self.

Welcome back: to both of us!
